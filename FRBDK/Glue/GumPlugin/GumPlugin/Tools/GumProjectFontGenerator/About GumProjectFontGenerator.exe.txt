This app can be used to generate fonts for a Gum project. We used to use Gum.exe itself for
generating fonts, but this has some benefits:
* It is faster (roughly 0.5 - 1 second) due to fewer .dlls loaded, and possibly due to using a modern .net version
* It doesn't rely on XNA so it will not fail on machines that do not have XNA installed
* It will run on all platforms, making it easier to run FRB on Mac/Linux
